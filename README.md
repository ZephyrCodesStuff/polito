# üåô polito
`polito` is my all-in-one repository for everything I‚Äôve coded, almost-exclusively in Python, during my studies at the **Polytechnic University of Turin**.

### Here you can find:
- Various **utility tools** I‚Äôve made to make my own life easier
- My (over-engineered) **solutions to the various exercises** assigned during the lab classes
- Whatever else I‚Äôll ever need to keep somewhere

If you‚Äôre a student like me, feel free to look at my solutions to the exercises and, if they helped you understand what‚Äôs happening a little better than before, **please star the repo üåü!**
> ‚ö†Ô∏è Please note that often times, this will be some of the _worst_ code I've written. If you want to see some examples of better stuff, you should **absolutely** check my other repos out.

### ‚ú® Happy coding, developers!
