# ðŸŒ™ polito
`polito` is my all-in-one repository for everything Iâ€™ve coded, almost-exclusively in Python, during my studies at the **Polytechnic University of Turin**.

### Here you can find:
- Various **utility tools** Iâ€™ve made to make my own life easier
- My (over-engineered) **solutions to the various exercises** assigned during the lab classes
- Whatever else Iâ€™ll ever need to keep somewhere

If youâ€™re a student like me, feel free to look at my solutions to the exercises and, if they helped you understand whatâ€™s happening a little better than before, **please star the repo ðŸŒŸ!**

### âœ¨ Happy coding, developers!
