# 🌙 polito
`polito` is my all-in-one repository for everything I’ve coded, almost-exclusively in Python, during my studies at the **Polytechnic University of Turin**.

### Here you can find:
- Various **utility tools** I’ve made to make my own life easier
- My (over-engineered) **solutions to the various exercises** assigned during the lab classes
- Whatever else I’ll ever need to keep somewhere

If you’re a student like me, feel free to look at my solutions to the exercises and, if they helped you understand what’s happening a little better than before, **please star the repo 🌟!**
> ⚠️ Please note that often times, this will be some of the _worst_ code I've written, given my hatred for LeetCode-style problems.
> If you want to see some examples of better stuff, you should **absolutely** check my other repos out.

### ✨ Happy coding, developers!
